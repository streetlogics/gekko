This document will explain how to setup Gekko for trading. First make sure you [installed Gekko](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/tree/localDB#installing-gekko).

## Paper & live trading 

Gekko uses Technical Analysis to determine when to enter or leave the live market, at such a moment it can:

* Advice on what you should do (for example per email).
* Calculate the profits of all the advices so far.
* Automatically trade.

Gekko currently supports paper ~~& live trading~~ at the following exchanges:

* [Mt. Gox](https://mtgox.com/)
* [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com/)
* [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.net/)
* [cex.io](https://cex.io) (commodity exchange for mining power)

**rest of readme coming soon!**

## ~~Backtesting~~

~~You can also backtest strategies using Gekko. I am currently expanding and improving the backtester and I could use all the feedback I can get. Keep in mind that I currently would not suggest applying strategies for real investments based on the result, consider it alpha stage.~~

~~You can find more detailed information in the [document about Backtesting](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/master/docs/Backtesting.md) as well as how to set it up.~~
