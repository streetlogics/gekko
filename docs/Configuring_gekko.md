# Configuring Gekko

This file will explain all different parameters you can set in the [config](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/blob/master/config.js).

The easiest way to configure Gekko is in the normal zone of the config:

    config.normal = {
      enabled: true,
      exchange: 'MtGox', // 'MtGox', 'BTCe', 'Bitstamp' or 'cexio'
      currency: 'USD',
      asset: 'BTC',
      tradingEnabled: false,
      key: '',
      secret: '',
      username: 0 // only fill this is when using Bitstamp or cexio
    }

## Exchanges

Gekko currently supports these exchanges:

* [Mt. Gox](https://mtgox.com) (MtGox)
* [BTC-e](https://btc-e.com) (BTCe)*
* [Bitstamp](https://bitstamp.com) (Bitstamp)*
* [cex.io](https://cex.io) (cexio)

*Note that there currently is a DNS bug for the dataprovider of these exchanges. If you are unable to fetch data, please check [this issue](https://github.com/askmike/gekko/issues/51#issuecomment-29551099).

You have to tell Gekko what market to monitor on the selected exchange, A market is defined by a `currency` and an `asset`. here are all supported combinations per exchange:

* Mt. Gox:  
  currencies: USD, EUR, GBP, AUD, CAD, CHF, CNY, DKK, HKD, PLN, RUB, SGD, THB  
  assets: BTC  
  markets: USD/BTC, EUR/BTC, GBP/BTC, AUD/BTC, CAD/BTC, CHF/BTC, CNY/BTC, DKK/BTC, HKD/BTC, PLN/BTC, RUB/BTC, SGD/BTC, THB/BTC.

* BTC-e:  
  currencies: USD, EUR, RUR, BTC  
  assets: BTC, LTC, NMC, NVC, USD, EUR, TRC, PPC, FTC, XPM  
  markets: USD/BTC, RUR/BTC, EUR/BTC, BTC/LTC, USD/LTC, RUR/LTC, EUR/LTC, BTC/NMC, USD/NMC, BTC/NVC, USD/NVC, RUR/USD, USD/EUR, BTC/TRC, BTC/PPC, USD/PPC, BTC/FTC, BTC/XPM.

* Bitstamp:  
  currencies: USD  
  assets: BTC  
  markets: USD/BTC
  
* cex.io:  
  currencies: BTC, *NMC (not yet supported)*  
  assets: GHS  
  markets: BTC/GHS

*Even though Bitcoin is a currency Gekko treats is like an asset when you are trading USD vs BTC.*

## Real trading

If you want to let Gekko trade on your account you also need to fill in your `key` and `secret` (~~with a clientID - your username - if you want to trade at Bitstamp~~ or cexio - Real trading is not working on Bitstamp right now) and set `tradingEnabled` to true. You can get the key and secret on the websites of the exchanges. Gekko only needs trade rights to create the trade orders.

## EMA Settings

You can configure all EMA settings Gekko will use to base its advice on. They are all explained in the config.

## Mail advice

Gekko will always log the advice it gives. You can also let Gekko mail you new advice to buy or sell. 

Gekko will need to know your email password.  If you do not wish to store this in the config.js then gekko will prompt for the password on startup.

Email Settings:
enabled: true 			Send Emails if true, false to turn off
sendMailOnStart: true		Send 'Gekko starting' message if true, not if false

Email: 'me@gmail.com'	Your GMail address
password: ''		Your GMail Password - if not supplied Gekko will prompt on startup.

If you are not using GMail then you will need to set the advanced settings in the config.js.

**WARNING: If you have NOT downloaded Gekko from the original github page we CANNOT guarantee that your email address & password are safe!**


## Profit Calculator

Gekko can calculate the profit of its advice by using a trade simulation.

    config.profitCalculator = {
      enabled: true,
      reportInCurrency: true,
      simulationBalance: {
        asset: 1,
        currency: 100,
      },
      verbose: true
    }

The calculator listens to Gekko's advice and on a sell it will swap all (simulated) currency into (simulated) assets at the current price. On a buy it will be the other way around. If you set `reportInCurrency` to false the profit will be calculated in `asset` instead of `currency` (the ones you set in the normal zone). When you set `verbose` to false Gekko will only report the profit after a sell instead of after every interval.

## The advanced zone

If you want to monitor an exchange but act on a different one, or watch a single exchange and act on multiple exchanges based on the advice you have to disable (or uncomment) the normal zone and configure the advanced zone: 

### Set the watcher

The watcher is the exchange Gekko pulls trade data from to analyze and detect trend. Set it as you would set the market in the normal zone.

### Set traders

The traders are objects with properties reflecting the exchange, the market and the credentials to create orders. The objects need to have the same structure as the object in the normal zone.
